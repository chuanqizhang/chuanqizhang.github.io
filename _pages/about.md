I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Centre for Quantum Software and Information](https://www.uts.edu.au/our-research-archived/centre-quantum-software-and-information), [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), where I feel very fortunate to be advised by [Prof Youming Qiao](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Youming.Qiao/), as well as co-advised by [Prof Mingsheng Ying](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Mingsheng.Ying) and [Prof Troy Lee](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Troy.Lee/). 

My research interests lie in a broad area between mathematics and theoretical computer science. Specifically, I have been involving myself in algebraic isomorphism problems and algorithms, multilinear algebra with implications for quantum information, tensor decomposition with applications in quantum machine learning, and group-based cryptography. Before my Ph.D. journey, I earned my B.Sc. and M.A. in Mathematics from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) and the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), respectively.
