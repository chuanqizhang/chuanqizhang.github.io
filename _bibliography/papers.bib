  abstract={Given a bipartite graph $G$, the graphical matrix space $\cS_G$ consists of 
matrices whose non-zero entries can only be at those positions corresponding 
to edges in $G$. Tutte (\emph{J. London Math. Soc.}, 1947), Edmonds (\emph{J. Res. Nat. Bur. Standards Sect. B}, 1967) and Lov\'asz (\emph{FCT}, 1979) observed connections between perfect matchings in $G$ 
and full-rank matrices in $\cS_G$. Dieudonn\'e (\emph{Arch. Math.}, 1948) proved a 
tight upper bound on the dimensions of those matrix spaces containing only 
singular matrices. The starting point of this paper is a simultaneous 
generalization of these two classical results: we show that the largest dimension 
over subspaces of $\cS_G$ containing only singular matrices is equal to the 
maximum 
size over subgraphs of $G$ without perfect matchings, based on Meshulam's proof of 
Dieudonn\'e's result
(\emph{Quart. J. Math.}, 1985).

Starting from this result, we go on to establish more connections between properties of graphs and matrix spaces. For example, we establish connections between acyclicity and nilpotency,
between strong connectivity and irreducibility, and between isomorphism and conjugacy/congruence. 
For each connection, we study three types of correspondences, namely the basic 
correspondence, the inherited correspondence (for subgraphs and subspaces), and 
the induced correspondence (for induced subgraphs and restrictions). Some 
correspondences lead to intriguing generalizations of classical results, such as Dieudonn\'e's result mentioned above, and a celebrated theorem of Gerstenhaber regarding the largest dimension of nil matrix spaces (\emph{Amer. J. 
Math.}, 1958). 

Finally, we show some implications of our results to quantum information and 
present open problems in computational complexity motivated by 
these results. },

  title={TEST: Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
